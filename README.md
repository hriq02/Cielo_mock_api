# Cielo Mock API

<h2>About</h2>
<div>This is a mock from the Cielo pagamento link API.</div>
<div>Is only for testing pourpuses, has no impact on other services, only relys on itself.</div>
<div>I used the docs from https://developercielo.github.io/manual/linkdepagamentos as a base to build this api.</div>


<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<div>Cielo is not envolved in this project nor i am envolved with them, this is only a mimic a fraction of their services, it does not replace their work.</div>

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<h4>if you want, there already a Dockerfile, so you can build it without needing for the following steps</h4>

<div></div>
<div>npm install -> will install all the dependencies</div>
<div>npm run start:dev -> will run in development mode</div>
<div>npm build -> will build the project</div>
<div>npm run start:prod -> will run in production mode</div>
